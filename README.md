# Testing
i have been able to work out colors that go well together as well as doing some media queries so that small phones also can play the Quiz.
in the begninning it was a little to bif font-size and margins in the main continer, so i had to cut everything down a bit and i think it came together really good in the end.

## Validator testing
W3C validator found no errors for HTML

Jigsaw validator found no errors for CSS

Jshint validator found no errors for Javascript

## Bugs
I dont have any clear bugs that are not fixed, but i came across some minor things i thought where strange. The preview using http.server from gitpod seemed to stopped working sometimes and sometimes it worked perfectly, sometimes the launched site and the python3 -m http.server preview showed different versions even tho i pushed everything before comparing.  also the github servers went down for Europe the last day before deadline which was unfortunate but not much to do about it. 

# Deployment
The site was deployed to github pages.
The steps to do this is :
Go to your repository, go to the settings tab, scroll down
until you find github pages,
Select main on branches, and press save, 
Once this is done you have to wait a few minutes and then it is live on Github Pages.
